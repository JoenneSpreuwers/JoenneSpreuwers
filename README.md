# Hi there! :wave:

## :rocket: About me

:mortar_board: I am **Joenne Spreuwers**, a 15yo Belgian student that likes to code in his free time. I'm currently studying __Sciences__ and looking forward to go study __Networking__ and getting my [__Network+__](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network)/[__CCNA__](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html) afterward. In my free time, I love to game and work on my [home lab](#markdown-header-Home-lab).
